**Fappet** is a **1.12.2** Forge Minecraft an addon mod for the mod [Mappet](https://github.com/mchorse/mappet/).


## Install

Install [Minecraft Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/).

Install [Mappet](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mappet) and all its requirements.

Install [MixinBooter](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mixin-booter).

Put them in minecraft's `mods` folder, and launch the game.

After that, Mappet mod should be installed and will appear in Minecraft's mods menu. If Mappet didn't appear in the mods menu, then something went wrong.


Special thanks to:

[McHorse](https://mchorse.github.io/), as I learned most of what I can from his clean & clear codes, and sometime from him personally! (even what you're reading right now is inspired by his documenting style)

[CleanroomMC](https://github.com/CleanroomMC/) and their community for the help making the workspace.

[TorayLife](https://github.com/TorayLife/) for helping me and suggesting working with mixins.
